# SUPERMAGMA

It's a tool to instantly skip past the edgy story and unlock the fun endless mode in [SUPERHOT](https://www.gog.com/game/superhot)

Just run it and it'll prompt you to select your save files, these should be named `super.hot`, `super_2.hot`, and `super_3.hot`. Select them all. If it doesn't automatically open up to the save folder, [browse to it manually](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Superhot#Save_game_data_location).

## FAQ

### iS ThiS viruz?

It's literally 250 lines of code. Go look at it then compile it yourself.

### B-but you're missing out on the wonderful story!

If I wanted story, I'd go play [Katana Zero](https://www.gog.com/game/katana_zero) or [Ori and the Blind Forest](https://www.gog.com/game/ori_and_the_blind_forest_definitive_edition). They're actually good at storytelling, and don't lie to you game's store page about the game's nature.
